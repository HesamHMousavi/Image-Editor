Test Plan:
I am planning on testing my program recursively After 
implementing a feature, small or big test before I continue.
I aim to test the program's sub-sections individually first
Then zooming out and test bigger sub-sections.
Finally, once all the tests pass without any errors, 
I should aim to test the whole program as a collective
of modules and debug any errors. The prinf() function 
will be used a lot as I would like to see the value of
the variables and compare their value with the expected one.

The inputs given via the command line could
contain some data that is not compatible with the
program therefore I am aming to test the program
with unfimiler inputs and bullet proofing it so
no crashes are caused in that case.
